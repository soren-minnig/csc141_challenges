The Albright Public Safety need some help with checking if people
are speeding. 


1. You will ensure that you have left 3 comments at the top of your file
    # Your Name
    # Date
    # brief description of what this file does

2. For this program, you must prompt the user to enter the speed limit
    and the speed at which they were driving.

3. Once you have collected your data, you will check if the user was in fact
    speeding or not using conditional statements. If they are speeding, print
    a message that says they are speeding, else if they are excessivley speeding,
    show a message that says so, otherwise, show a message that lets
    them know they are safe. Your choice for what your messages say as long
    as they make sense. 

    *** Excessive speeding is considered 30mph over the posted speed limit ***

4. After completing above 3 steps, remove all comments in this file that are
    not your own and do not forget to rename this file to speedTrap.py
