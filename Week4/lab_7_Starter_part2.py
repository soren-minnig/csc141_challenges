Canvas's grade checker is broken and you need to fix it! 


1. You will ensure that you have left 3 comments at the top of your file
    # Your Name
    # Date
    # brief description of what this file does

2. For this program, you must prompt the user to enter their final grade score

3. Once you have collected your data, you will use ONE multi-branch conditional
    statement to print a message that reflects the letter grade that they have
    received. Additionaly, if the user enters a value above 100 and or below 0,
    show a message that an error has occured

    *** Use the following grade scale ***
                100-90 = A
                89-80  = B
                79-70  = C
                69-60  = D
                59-0   = F

4. After completing above 3 steps, remove all comments in this file that are
    not your own and do not forget to rename this file to studentGrade.py
